Data Warehouse Project: Integrated Data Warehouse: A unified data warehouse which will integrate data from FudgeFlix and Fudgemart databases
Fudgemart, Inc., operating through its subsidiaries Fudgemart and Fudgeflix, accumulates a vast amount of data from its online retail and streaming operations, as well as from external sources. However, this data is currently siloed and underutilized, representing a significant missed opportunity. 
By investing in a comprehensive Business Warehouse/Business Intelligence (BW/BI) solution, Fudgemart, Inc. can transform this raw data into actionable insights, driving improved decision-making, greater efficiency, and increased profitability.

The following deliverables are required:
1.	Detailed report on Sales Analysis based on Region
2.	Detailed report on Sales Anaysis by Supplier
3.	Detailed report on Sales based on Product
